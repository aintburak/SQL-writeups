# SQL and PL/SQL

This repository contains examples and resources related to SQL and PL/SQL programming languages.

## SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and managing relational databases. SQL is used to manipulate and query data stored in databases, and it is widely used in web development, data science, and other fields.

### SQL Examples

In the `sql_examples/` directory, you will find examples of SQL queries for various use cases. These examples include:

- Basic SELECT statements: demonstrates how to retrieve data from a single table
- Joins: shows how to combine data from multiple tables using different types of joins
- Aggregation functions: illustrates how to use functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, and MAX to summarize data
- Subqueries: demonstrates how to use a SELECT statement within another SELECT statement to retrieve data from multiple tables

## PL/SQL

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is an extension of SQL that is used to write procedural programs for Oracle databases. PL/SQL supports variables, control structures, and other programming language features that are not available in SQL.

### PL/SQL Examples

In the `plsql_examples/` directory, you will find examples of PL/SQL code for various use cases. These examples include:

- Stored procedures: demonstrates how to define and call a stored procedure
- Cursors: shows how to use cursors to iterate over a result set and perform operations on each row
- Exception handling: illustrates how to handle exceptions that may occur during program execution
- Triggers: demonstrates how to use triggers to automatically perform actions in response to database events

## Resources

In the directories above, you will find links to useful resources related to SQL and PL/SQL programming. These resources include:

- Online tutorials and courses: links to free and paid resources for learning SQL and PL/SQL
- Documentation for SQL and PL/SQL: links to official documentation for SQL and PL/SQL, as well as community-contributed documentation
